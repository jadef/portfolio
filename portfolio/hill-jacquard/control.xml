		This was a portfolio website that I programmed for a fellow designer, Jonathon Hill-Jacquard. Most of the design work was done by Jonathon. My original scope included taking his concept and programming it with html, css, and javascript (jquery). The site was later translated into a WordPress theme to allow for easier content management.

		The main purpose of the site is to show Jonathon's work. The portfolio was segmented into two areas for his design and illustration work.

		Jonathon's blog was originally a wordpress.com site separate from his portfolio site. To fix this disparity and streamline content population, a new WordPress theme was created that combines the existing site pages with a new index and post layout.
