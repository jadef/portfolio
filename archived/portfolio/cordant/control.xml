		<description><![CDATA[ This is a microsite created for the diabetic line of <a href="http://www.amfit.com/">Amfit</a> inserts. I designed and programmed the site to be used as part of Amfit's campaign, educating their customers (Orthopedists and Pedorthists) about the new line of diabetic inserts while capturing new leads. The site is programmed with xhtml, css, and javascript (jquery).

		<description>The site is enhanced by the small details throughout. Such as slight clipping on the insert images with subtle drop shadows for depth. Or the custom check boxes to retain the look of the form.
