    "content": "<p>Development is a form of building, and as an intrinsic builder, I always apply logic and reason to every situation, bringing a linear way of thinking to solve problems or discover how things work. Let's face it, you would want a web developer to be organized, always putting the right things where they belong.</p>\n<p>My process-oriented mentality serves me well as a front-end developer, where I excel in translating user's needs, designer's choices, and code solutions to build the right answer to practical problems.</p>"
